# Eco Model

## Overview
Eco Model serves to model an ecological system in prolog. The model provides two applications through which users can interact with the model and knowledge base:

### 1. Ecological Queries
The user can query the system using natural language. Eco Model uses natural language processing to parse queries and return answers from the knowledge base.
### 2. Animal Guessing Game
Using a binary search tree, the application can successfully guess any animal the user is thinking of using facts about the animal defined in the program. The game uses a caching system to remember previous responses and prevent redundancy.

## Using the Application
