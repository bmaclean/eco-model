# Eco Model

## Overview
Eco Model serves to model an ecological system in prolog. The model provides two applications through which users can interact with the model and knowledge base:

### 1. Ecological Queries
The user can query the system using natural language. Eco Model uses natural language processing to parse queries and return answers from the knowledge base.
### 2. Dynamic Addition into Dataset
If the user has all the properties of a given animal, and wants to ask Eco Model questions about its population or other predicates, Eco Model allows for the dynamic addition of animals into the dataset.
